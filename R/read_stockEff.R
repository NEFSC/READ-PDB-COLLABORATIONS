#' @title read_stockEff
#' @description Function reads stockEff products into R and saves as a time-stamped list.
#' Options allow data to be pulled for different species, stocks, production status, modules, and sex types.
#' This is essentially an R function wrapper around the "Connecting to StockEff via R" example user guide in confluence.
#'
#' @param doLogin A boolean, if TRUE then function will ask for login credentials, if FALSE then function assumes connection has already been made to stockEff and code will use existing global "login" object to run (good option if nesting multiple calls within same R script). Default = TRUE
#' @param species_itis 6 digit ITIS identifying the species for which data should be pulled, no default.
#' @param stock_abbrev A string describing the stock abbreviation assigned by stock efficiency (this shows up in the web address for STOCKEFF products), no default.
#' @param sex_type A string describing the sex type for which data should be pulled (this shows up in the web address for STOCKEFF products), default = "NONE". Common options include "NONE", "MALE", "FEMALE", "UNSEXED"
#' @param mode A string indicating production "prod" or pre-production "test" modes, default = "prod"
#' @param module A string indicating the module for which products will be pulled, no default. Options include:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item{"survey" - Correspond to SV tab in stockEff}
#'   \item{"commercial" - Correspond to CF tab in stockEff}
#'   \item{"observer" - Correspond to OB tab in stockEff}
#'   \item{Nothing yet available for MRIP tab (as of 3/6/24)}
#' }
#' @param product A vector of strings corresponding to the CSV files available in the SV modual of STOCKEFF, names should NOT need to include ".csv" extensions. No default.
#' @param outdir A directory where temporary files will be stored during processing (deleted when function finishes running), and final RDS object will be saved. Default to here::here().
#' @param saveout A boolean, if TRUE also provide outname argument for saved copy of output, otherwise results returned to R but not saved, default = TRUE.
#' @param outname A string to use as the output file name (will always be time stamped, do NOT add file extension to name), default = paste0("stockEff_",module) with timestamp.
#'
#' @return An R list object where each item in the list corresponds to a product that was pulled from stockEff and an additional date_pulled object with the time stamp. If saveout = TRUE then this object is also saved as an RData file. When returned RData file is loaded into R it will automatically be named "stockEff_storage"

#' @examples
#' # GB cod survey pre-production survey example
#' read_stockEff(species_itis = 164712, stock_abbrev = "GBK", sex_type = "NONE", module = "survey", mode = "test", product = c("strat_mean", "strat_mean_length"), outname = "example_GBcod_survey")
#' # Female spiny dogfish production survey example
#' read_stockEff(species_itis = 160617, stock_abbrev = "UNIT", sex_type = "FEMALE", module = "survey", mode = "prod", product = c("strat_mean", "strat_mean_length"), outname = "example_FEMALEdogfish_survey")
#' # Butterfish production CF example
#' read_stockEff(doLogin = FALSE, species_itis = 172567, stock_abbrev = "UNIT", sex_type = "NONE", module = "commercial", mode = "prod", product = c("landings_gear", "bio_data_summary"), outname = "example_butterfish_CF")
#'
#' NOTE:
#' - You must have the httr package loaded to run this function if you are not using the pdbCollaborations package implementation
#' - The function cannot query assessment_info.csv products (you will get the following error if you try: "Error in read.table ... more columns than column names")
#' @export
